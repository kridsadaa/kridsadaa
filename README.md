# Hi there, I'm Kridsada 👋
Industrial AI & Robotics Integrator | Enterprise MES Architect | Backend Specialist
I am a Systems Architect and Full-Stack Integrator with a B.Eng. in Mechatronics (1st Class Honors). I specialize in bridging the gap between legacy industrial hardware and modern AI intelligence. My expertise lies in modernizing robotics with LLMs, architecting mission-critical MES with deep SAP integration, and building high-performance Smart Factory ecosystems.

🚀 High-Impact Projects
🤖 [Enterprise AI-Robotics Modernization]
Modernizing legacy robots with LLMs & Real-time Audio Pipelines.

Cognitive Layer Decoupling: Bypassed hardware obsolescence by moving the AI brain to a high-performance server using WebSockets.

Hybrid Audio Pipeline: Implemented Audio DSP (Noise Gating, Hysteresis) and VAD for fluid human-robot interaction in noisy factory environments.

Context Retention: Built a persistent session management system using NestJS/MongoDB for long-term human-robot memory.

🏭 [Mission-Critical MES & SAP Integration]
Digitizing the production lifecycle for a Public Company (SNC Former).

SAP Direct Sync: Engineered a real-time data pipeline with SAP ERP for BOM validation and production synchronization.

Shift-Aware Logic: Developed complex algorithms to handle automated production dating and machine interlocking based on real-time sensor data.

Inventory Traceability: Designed a granular stock-tracking system (Location/Position/Lot) with high-performance Aggregation Pipelines.

📦 [Smart WMS with Digital Twin Interface]
Full-stack Warehouse Management with Real-time Visualization.

Interactive Dashboard: Built a dynamic warehouse layout (Digital Twin) using React for real-time pallet tracking.

Concurrency Control: Implemented PostgreSQL Advisory Locks for atomic serial number generation in high-volume environments.

🧘 The Man Behind the Code
The Disciplined Sage: A fitness-driven Trail Runner (25km finisher) and Acting Sub-Lieutenant (ROTC Class 5). I believe that physical discipline fuels mental clarity and engineering precision.

Old Soul & Neo-Heritage: Inspired by history and archaeology. I apply the "Kintsugi" philosophy—finding strength in resilience and perfection in thoughtful system design.
